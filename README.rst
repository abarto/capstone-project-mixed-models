Mixed Models Capstone Project
=============================

This project contains the code for my Captsone Project (or Thesis) of my BSc in Computer Science degree. It is an application to fit mixed models based on SAS/STAT`s `PROC MIXED <https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#mixed_toc.htm>`_ written in Delphi/ObjectPascal (works with `Lazarus <http://www.lazarus-ide.org/>`_ and `FreePascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>`_ too).

The repository contains three separate projects:

- ProjectModelosMixtos: A tool with a GUI to define the case and fit the model.
- ProjectModelosMixtosConsole: A console based application. It takes the same definitions as ProjectModelosMixtos but has no GUI.
- ProjectSimuladorModelosMixtos: A tool to simulate samples with a given covariance matrix.

About the code
--------------

As mentioned before, the code is written in Delphi/ObjectPascal, and it's entirely in Spanish. It is thoroughly documented but the design quality is somewhat lacking.

Issues/Feature requests
-----------------------

I don't intend to work on this anymore, but I can try to provide some guidance if you want to make use of it.
